# Multi-Stock Simulation

## Objective
Simulate daily price paths for multiple stocks and visualize them.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Random daily returns using `np.random.normal`
- Compounding prices with `np.cumprod`
- Plotting multiple stock price paths using Matplotlib

## Next Steps / Ideas
- Introduce correlation between stock returns
- Monte Carlo simulation with multiple paths per stock
- Portfolio risk analysis
